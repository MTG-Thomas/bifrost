"""Regression coverage for the disappearing-entity race (plan Task 11).

The original bug (plan lines 12-19): the UI creates an event source via
``POST /api/events/sources`` while a ``bifrost watch`` session in another
terminal picks up an unrelated file change.  The old watch batch also
re-pushed the local ``.bifrost/`` manifest, which did NOT contain the
freshly-created entity — so server-side manifest import with
``delete_removed_entities=True`` promptly deleted the entity the user had
just created.

Task 8 fixed this structurally by:

* Excluding ``.bifrost/`` from the watchdog observer (see
  ``_WatchChangeHandler`` in ``api/bifrost/cli.py`` — ``_spec`` layers a
  ``.bifrost/`` exclusion on top of the shared push/pull filter).
* Deleting the manifest-push branch of ``_process_watch_batch``. Watch now
  only calls per-file ``/api/files/write`` and ``/api/files/delete``; it
  never calls ``/api/files/manifest/import`` and never sends ``.bifrost/``
  content to the server.

This test asserts the race is structurally impossible by driving the watch
internals directly against the real API:

1. Create an event source via the API (the "UI side" of the race).
2. Stage both an unrelated ``workflows/foo.py`` change AND a ``.bifrost/
   events.yaml`` change in a temp workspace, and dispatch watchdog-shaped
   events through ``_WatchChangeHandler``. The handler must skip
   ``.bifrost/`` before anything reaches the queue.
3. Run ``_process_watch_batch`` against a ``BifrostClient`` wrapped so every
   HTTP call is captured.
4. Assert:
   * The event source still exists (``GET /api/events/sources/{id}`` → 200).
   * No recorded call is a DELETE against ``/api/events/sources/...``.
   * No recorded call targets ``/api/files/manifest/import`` (the old bulk
     push path is gone).
   * ``.bifrost/events.yaml`` was never queued as a push (structural check
     on the handler's filter).
